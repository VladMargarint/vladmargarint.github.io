                <h1>International Knowledge Sharing Initiative  IKSI </h1>


<p>Welcome to the International Knowledge Sharing Initiative page!</p>

<p>The idea of the project is to link Researchers, Professors, Postdocs and PhD communities in certain disciplines with local highschools and Teaching/ Tech Institutions that are interested in implementing a large public talk and that are located at the places where the researchers travel during Conferences, Workshops and related events.  We emphasize that this large public talk and training is happening in the extra time and will not perturb the interaction that happens between professionals during the Conferences, Workshops etc. For experienced speakers with teaching techniques we aim to add an additional workshop part (for those who want) to train the students in effective learning techniques according to relevant research literature on the topic and expertise advice(see below). If opportunities appear, we plan to help also by organising events to discuss and share between us (the traveling researchers and staff fom local Universities and Highschools) effective teaching techniques based on the research literature on the topic. </p>

<p><b>Benefits and opportunities</b></p>
 <p>A) Large public talk part:  One of the benefits of this project is the interaction between University staff and Highschool staff with the interest to train and to prepare for next challenges from the early age the next generation of students. Also, via the outreach part, we aim to motivate the students to follow a career in research/academia. </p>

<p>
B) Workshop part: The second  benefit is to offer highschool students an overview of learning techniques  according to current research on the topic: Concretely, outside of the outreach talk, we plan to organize a session on techniques about how to learn effectively based on studies from peer-reviewd research articles. We plan also to implement pats of the techniques with them via small group projects, etc.; This part is one of the differences that makes the experience valuable outside of the outreach part.</p>


<p><b>The project has two phases:</b></p> 

<p><b>1. The ‘online’ phase </b> (before we are allowed to go back to travel):
In this phase, we establish online contact with the researchers on one side and with the highschools and local institutions on the other side.  We provide Tech/Teaching institutions and highschools a list of people from research that would like to get involved to share knowledge to the interested people communities.
Note: This phase can be implemented time to time also after the lockdown period is over, in order to reduce the carbon footprint in the future. 
[More details to follow].</p>

<p><b>2. The ‘offline’ phase:</b>
One of the key features of a job in Academia is that the researchers travel (a lot!) outside and during term.  This initiative would like to help in the sense explained in the introduction paragraph, i.e. to organize large public talks linked with workshops on effective learning techniques based on research articles and discussions with experts in accordance with the travel plans of the researchers who would like to get involved.
[More details to follow].</p>



<p><b>Organization procedure:</b>
We store and regularly update a database. We start from few centers with local contacts and we expand in time to the wider audience as possible in the future after we learn by experiencing it.</p>
